# jQuery.Syntax

jQuery.Syntax is a light-weight client-side syntax highlighter, which dynamically loads external dependencies (JavaScript & CSS) when required. It uses jQuery to make it cross-browser compatible and to simplify integration and integration with other systems.

## Motivation

jQuery.Syntax was built at a time when syntax highlighting on the web was a bit of a mess - browser incompatibilities and limitations made it hard to do the right thing consistently. Rather than a single definition of "good", presenting code nicely in a browser was dictated by a set of trade-offs.

At the time, syntax highlighters were often all-or-nothing - this made it cumbersome for sites that only had a few pages with code on them. jQuery.Syntax was designed from the ground up to use dynamic loading of assets when required. On top of that, the implementation was built using a profiler and is fairly efficient.

It's a good library and it's fast, that's why I continue to maintain and develop it.

### Isn't jQuery big?

Your right, small is pretty subjective.

jQuery as a dependency is based on a design from 2012. When browsers were a bit less "compatible", this was a good trade-off. These days, it could probably be removed, but it isn't worth the effort and for me personally it's a zero-cost dependency since I use it anyway on most of my sites.

The library is modular and only loads exactly the CSS and JS required. The minimised and gzipped library is 1.6Kbytes, this provide the top-level API and the dynamic loading functionality.

To highlight anything, you need to load the core parser and renderer code. It's 4.1Kbytes minified and gzipped. The CSS and Script files are tiny, most less < 1Kbyte, per language.

### Compared to xyz?

All syntax highlighters are pretty good these days. But, there are some key differences worth considering:

- How much does it load by default, even when not highlighting anything?
- How efficient/fast is it when highlighting code?
- How does line wrapping work?
- Can you embed `<span>` and `<a>` elements?
- Can it handle embedded code (e.g. JavaScript inside HTML)?
- Is it easy to install?
- Is it easy to customize?

## Installation

jQuery.Syntax is easily installed using `yarn`.

	$ yarn install jquery-syntax

It has a `dist/` directory which follows standard conventions.

### Advanced Configuration

jQuery.Syntax compiles and minifies it's code using uses [`bake`](https://github.com/ioquatix/bake) (Ruby) and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com). Please review the included `bake.rb` and `install.yaml` for more details.

## Usage

jQuery.Syntax is typically used to highlight both block code elements and inline code elements. To highlight code, you first need to include several scripts in the `<head>` of your page:

	<!-- Put in your head tag -->
	<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script src="jquery.syntax.min.js"></script>
	
	<script type="text/javascript">
		// This function is executed when the page has finished loading.
		jQuery(function($) {
			$.syntax({theme: 'bright'});
		});
	</script>
	
	<!-- Your code to highlight -->
	<pre><code class="language-ruby">puts "Hello World"</code></pre>

### Stylesheet Compatibility

The following stylesheet sets some useful defaults and enables responsive tab-size indentation.

```css
html {
	font-size: 16px;
	
	/* Fix odd text-size in `display: flex` elements on Safari iOS */
	text-size-adjust: 100%;
	-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;
}

@media (min-width: 40em) {
	html {
		font-size: 18px;
		--tab-size: 4;
	}
}

@media (min-width: 80em) {
	html {
		font-size: 20px;
		--tab-size: 4;
	}
}

pre {
	/* -moz-tab-size is still required by Firefox */
	--tab-size: 2;
	tab-size: var(--tab-size);
	-moz-tab-size: var(--tab-size);
}
```
